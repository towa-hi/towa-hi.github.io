			>T: I feel like I'm doing this wrong. I need a nested state machine for die. Death should happen regardless of state.<br>
			>T: there's no reason to even hav direction in the state graph<br>
			>C: sure there is, prevents bad transitions<br>
			>T: hm<br>
			>T: this graph is going to get complicated really quick then<br>
			>T: this would be easier to write if I had a superstate for dead/alive<br>

			>T: can I have multiple state machines, with one taking precedence over another? <br>
			>L: remember all your lines between states should essentially be booleans<br>
			>T: I think they all are<br>
			>T: I guess nested state machines are basically how video games work.<br>
			>T: https://barrgroup.com/embedded-systems/how-to/introduction-hierarchical-state-machines<br>
			>L: yea nested state machines are very common<br>
			>L: UE4 is full of them, especially in the animation system.<br>
			>L: A state might be "walking" instead of "jumping" or "standing", and then walking has it's own state machine to determine the type of walk (direction, speed)<br>
			>T: for something like Mario he would need multiple fsms. one for dead/alive, one for horizontal vector, one for jumping/on ground<br>
			>T: and also this one<br>

		<p>Coffee for breakfast. Working through the 2d Roguelike tutorial for Unity. Ran into an annoying issue involving this error:<b>Project has invalid dependencies: com.unity.package-manager-ui: Package [com.unity.package-manager-ui@2.1.2] cannot be found</b>. I fixed it by reimporting all my packages. Then I ran into this annoying thing:</p>

		<p>This one I fixed by logging out of my Unity account, running the game and then logging back in. I don't know what that was all about.</p>

	    <p>Today I played some ring fit adventure. I'm 3 weeks in and it's getting quite challenging. I burned 40 calories today after a quick 20 minute session. They should make more games that use this peripheral.</p>
